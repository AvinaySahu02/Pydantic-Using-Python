# Pydantic-Using-Python

Pydantic is a powerful Python library used for data validation, parsing, and settings management by leveraging Python type hints. It ensures that data used in applications is clean, structured, and type-safe, making it a core dependency in modern backend and AI frameworks like FastAPI. This repository contains the code implemented while learning Pydantic as part of the Full Stack AI with Python course.
